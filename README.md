# Document Recommendation using Vector Space Model

A Document Recommendation Program built in Python.<br><br>
This program recommends the most appropriate Recipe from the collection of Recipe documents according to the Query (input) of the user.<br>

The program follows the following steps:<br>

> -  Preprocessing all the input documents from the document collection, and producing valid tokens.
> - Representing every token from the documents as a vector in the Vector Space Model.
> - Calculating the df (Document Frequency) and TF-IDF (Term Frequency â€” Inverse Document Frequency) for every token.
> - Calculating the length of Document Vectors for calcluating the Cosine Similarity
<br>

> - Preprocessing the Query Document, which is the input from the user, and finding the most relevant tokens.
> - Calculating TF-IDF of these tokens and representing these tokens as vectors.
> - Applying Cosine Similarity on the Query tokens and the Document Tokens to find the most relevant document.

The most relevant document is then displayed to the user, along with the names of all matching documents.


Sample Input:

```
Recipies containing milk
```

Output:
```
Cosine similarities of the Query document with the given documents are: 

 {'DOC1': 0.0935500990115709, 'DOC2': 0.0, 'DOC3': 0.0, 'DOC4': 0.0, 'DOC5': 0.0, 'DOC6': 0.0, 'DOC7': 0.0, 'DOC8': 0.10908954076547449, 'DOC9': 0.0, 'DOC10': 0.0}


The reccomended documents are: ['DOC1', 'DOC8']


Displaying the most relevent document i.e  DOC8
