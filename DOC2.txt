Ingredients of Dosa

4 Servings
2 cup idli rice
1 cup urad dal
2 cup water
1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon refined oil
How to make Dosa
Step 1
To prepare this dosa recipe, wash idli rice and urad dal in water 3-4 times. Once you are done with washing, soak them separately for 4-5 hours. Then, soak fenugreek with urad dal. Once the dal and rice are soaked, grind urad dal first in a blender jar, followed by rice to a fine paste. Add water while grinding, as required. The batter should be of pancake consistency, let the batter ferment overnight.

Step 2
Heat a flat skillet or a frying pan over medium flame, grease it with some oil and using a ladle pour the batter into the pan and spread to cover the entire pan. Drizzle a little oil in the pan again and cook for about a minute. With a spatula fold the crisp dosa and transfer to a platter.

Step 3
Repeat with the rest of the batter to make more such dosas. Serve hot with sambar and coconut chutney.
