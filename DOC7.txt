There will be some water remaining, to which you can add curd, salt and soda bicarbonate. The batter should be in flowing consistency. In case it is thick, add a little water to it.

Let it rest for 15-20 minutes to ferment.

Step 4
After 20 minutes steam the idlies in a well greased mould for 8-10 minutes.
